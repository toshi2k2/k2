I am a PhD candidate at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), Baltimore in the Computer Science department being advised by [Dr. Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/). I am a part of the [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/) research group at Hopkins where we strive to develop mathematical models of vision and cognition.
